# GreenApp

## Inspiration
Our team was inspired to create an app that integrates all of the latest technologies to the best of our abilities using the content that we are currently learning in school.

## What it does
GreenApp enables users to create a local community to discuss various ways to reduce their carbon footprint, as well as have the ability to track their statistics and access an OpenAI model via API that can assist them in determining their next steps based upon any statistics that the user is tracking.

## How we built it
We used several tools, mainly the following:

1. Python
2. Flask
3. HTML/CSS
4. SQLAlchemy
5. Pandas
6. Matplotlib (Pyplot)
7. OpenAI API
8. Figma for Prototyping

## Challenges we ran into
The Project had many challenges, as well as the time constraint being a huge factor in play as well. Several key issues are listed below, and how we were able to get past them.
 - **Interfacing**: Our team had different roles, and our tasks had a lot of background work needing to be done. Putting the entire project together ran into a couple of issues just due to how the data and pages were configured, and was resolved through effective communication of necessary inputs and outputs beforehand.
- **Learning Curve**: There was a steep learning curve, and in order to be able to accomplish the amount of work needing to be done our team defined specific roles on what we were supposed to do as a part of the team based upon each of our skills.
- **Scope of Work**: There were a lot of ideas that could have been implemented, but not a lot of time to learn about them. Our team decided the best thing to do was a proof of concept for data analytics and forums, as well as future ways to improve the visualizations for end-users.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
Everyone on the team is guaranteed to walk away from this hackathon having learned new material. Some topics we learned are: utilizing Flask, leveraging API calls on the backend, and various ways to integrate different technologies together efficiently.

## What we learned
Sleep is pretty nice. This was also our first project that had anything to do with artificial intelligence, which was an awesome thing to learn on the fly as well.

## What's next for Green App
Some ideas:
- Gamify the journey of fighting climate change by socializing the process.
- Track more data (type of food consumed, clothing worn)
- Integrating locality (local farm, composting events, community leader board, etc.)
- Create a more robust web-page that is more intuitive and interactive with the user.
- Create a mobile app for a more seamless UX.
